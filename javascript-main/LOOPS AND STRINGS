// LOOPS
// same as the c for  the loops :
// for 
// while

// for loop can also be written on the objects like we write loop on map,and other containers
//lets build a guessing game:
// let number  = 25;
// let entered_num = prompt("guess the number");
// while(entered_num != number)
// {
//     entered_num = prompt("you guessed the number wrong ,try guessing it!");
// }
// console.log("hooray! , your guess is right");

//STRINGS
let str = "Apna college";
let str1 = "Akshaya";

//str.length give sthe length of the string
console.log(str.length);
console.log(str1.length);

//we can access strings in the same way in any language 
// -> we can acees the elemetns at any position on the string str[0],str[1],str[2]

//look at this code
console.log("str :" ,str,"str2:",str1); //instead of addign commas slowing down your typing speed
console.log(`str : ${str} str1:  ${str1}`);
//so the above ${} called as template literal
//so the above process is called as string interpolation 

//ESCAPE CHARACTERS
// like \n,\t
//but if you calculate the length of this string:Akshaya\ngood
//it is 12 
//escape characters are calculates as a single character
